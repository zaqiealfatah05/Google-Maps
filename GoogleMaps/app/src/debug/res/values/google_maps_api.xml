    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    50:0E:06:1D:A1:46:14:77:75:23:C7:C6:2B:B1:95:C8:C5:12:0B:F9

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
